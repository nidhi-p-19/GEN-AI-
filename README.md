# 🧠 LLM Chatbot Lab — Groq, Ollama & DeepSeek RAG Bots

Hello people! 👋

Hope everyone is doing good 😄

So here’s the thing — everyone these days is going mad behind **RAGs**, **Agentic LLMs**, **chatbots**, and everything **GenAI**... and guess what? I’m diving into the rabbit hole too. 

Now, if you’re someone who doesn’t want to go all in on hardcore ML or 10,000 lines of code but still wants to build smart stuff using the most booming tech out there — **GenAI is THE place** to start off.

I’ve been experimenting, tweaking, breaking (and fixing 😅) a bunch of things using:
- 🦙 Ollama for local LLMs
- ⚡ Groq API for crazy-fast inference
- 🧠 DeepSeek R1 for multilingual chat magic
- 📚 FAISS + LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🖥️ Streamlit + FastAPI for sleek UIs and APIs

So here’s a small lab setup — working chatbot projects that blend open-source and commercial LLMs to create cool stuff!
